My name is Sam Youles, and I am a postgraduate researcher at the Institute of Cosmology & Gravitation in Portsmouth.

## Research Interests
I study the Large Scale Structure of the Universe using the Lyman alpha forests from quasar spectra as tracers of the dark matter density field. I am a member of the extended [Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS)](https://www.sdss.org/surveys/eboss/) and [Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/) collaborations. I am currently investigating weak lensing of the Lyman alpha forest.
